# Human-Resource-Management-Software
In the present, we are living in an automated world. The first rule of any technology used 
in a business is that automation applied to an efficient operation will magnify the efficiency. 
Every business needs to be adjusted with modern technologies to compete in the business 
world. Colombo Institute of Studies has decided to build software to automate their 
business management tasks as they are currently handling employee details manually. 
Creating, planning, and designing are the first steps of building software. In this 
assignment, the proposed solution is created by applying Object Oriented Programming 
concepts as required. UML diagrams are the best way to provide the design solution for 
any concern. Developing a system using OOP concepts provides several advantages such 
as reusability, extensibility, maintainability, testability, and design patterns.
